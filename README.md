Figma GitHub Integration is a widget designed to integrate Figma with GitHub for project management in a modern way. This widget allows users to import issues, pull requests, and the entire project directly from GitHub to Figma. Also, users can create an issue from Figma.

The widget content is easily configurable, allowing users to customize their interaction with the widget according to their needs.


You can:

- Import issues, pull requests, and entire projects from GitHub to Figma. Supports import by URL and by [search](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#using-search-to-filter-issues-and-pull-requests).

- Create new issues for your repository or project directly from Figma.

- Customize the widget fields of your choice. These settings include the option to add [project fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields) (includes "Status" by default), [labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) (added by default), comments, milestones, as well as [links between pull requests and issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
